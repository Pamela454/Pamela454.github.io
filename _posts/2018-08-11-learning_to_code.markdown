        I am currently working as a nurse at an Academic Medical Center in Boston. Ensuring that you have the most current medical information for patients and parsing through current clinical data on your patient is important. Everyday we rely on software in the form of an electronic medical record as well as software within our monitoring equipment. This data is used to make clinical care decisions and provide information to patients on how to better manage their health once they leave the hospital. 
        Learning to code will allow me to solve problems and improve processes in healthcare delivery. These solutions can include preventing medical errors from reaching the patient as well as improving communication between medical provider teams.
